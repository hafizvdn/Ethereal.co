🚀 Ethereal.co Website

This repository contains my very first self-made website, Ethereal.co. This project was created as a primary learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of web development—specifically the core structure and styling of a website.

This is a personal milestone, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions!

✨ Project Goal & Focus

The main purpose of building Ethereal.co was to gain practical, hands-on experience with foundational web technologies.

HTML Structure: Learning how to properly organize content using semantic tags (<header>, <section>, <footer>, etc.).

CSS Styling: Understanding how to use external stylesheets, target elements with different selectors, and apply basic layout concepts like Flexbox (if used).

Web Design Basics: Practicing visual aesthetics, font choices, and color schemes.
